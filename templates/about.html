    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
        This platform is built to bridge the gap between students seeking attachment opportunities and companies offering them. 
        By providing a seamless way to post and apply, we ensure that both parties can find the best fit with ease.
        It also aimed at bridging students with tenants since in most cases usually secure an attachment in a strage place hence this platform will provide them with a chance to be able to secure a place to leave by having the tenants post there rentals in the platform.
